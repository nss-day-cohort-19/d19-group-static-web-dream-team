// Each item in the array must be an object that contains the following information: name, description, price, and URL for product image. You can add more properties if that's what the team wants, but it must have those.
// The team will use JavaScript to add each product to the DOM.
// Each product must be a card, much like everyone made in the Static Web quiz. As a team, decide on the style of the card.
// The layout of the product page should be a grid of cards. 3-wide, 4-wide, 5-wide, the teams must decide how many cards are on each row
